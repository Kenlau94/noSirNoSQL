# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Task

Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Youâ€™ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. A bit more complex compared to the e commerse and sql but overall a good challenge. No starter code usually hurt my feelings but got help for the initial structure. My initial code had a good bit of errors but through chat gtp helping with errors, youtube and my awesome classmates, I managed to power through. Initially went through the process of inputing everything into mongo but a class mate simplified the process. Hours wasted ðŸ’€.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Grading Requirements
